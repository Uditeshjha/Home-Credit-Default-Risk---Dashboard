- **üßæ Overview & Data Quality** ‚Äî Missingness, data types, initial distributions, quick quality checks.  
- **üéØ Target & Risk Segmentation** ‚Äî Target distribution, default rates across segments, riskiest cohorts.  
- **üë™ Demographics & Household Profile** ‚Äî Age, gender, family, children, occupation, household-level patterns.

## üìå What's implemented (high level)
- Modular multi-page Streamlit app (one page per business topic).
- Compressed the raw dataset and optimized the memory.  
- Professional, corporate warm color theme and consistent visuals.  
- Preprocessing pipeline (`utils/preprocessing.py`) that:
  - Creates derived columns: `AGE_YEARS`, `EMPLOYMENT_YEARS`, `DTI`, `LTI`, `ANNUITY_TO_CREDIT`.  
  - Handles missing values (drop very-high-missing columns, impute median/mode for others).  
  - Standardizes categories (merge rare labels to ‚ÄúOther‚Äù).
  - Defines `INCOME_BRACKET` quantiles (Low / Mid / High).  
- Global sidebar filters (persist across pages): Gender, Education, Family Status, Housing Type, Age Range, Income Bracket, Employment Tenure.  
- Faster visual alternatives for heavy plots (hexbin/hist2d for joint densities, sampling where needed).  
- Processed outputs saved as `full_cleaned.csv` and `full_cleaned.pkl` (via `pp.save_processed_data()`).  
- Simple caching / load-from-processed logic so app is responsive after first preprocess.

## üîç Derived columns (how they are computed)
- `AGE_YEARS = -DAYS_BIRTH / 365.25`  
- `EMPLOYMENT_YEARS = clip(-DAYS_EMPLOYED / 365.25)` (clip sentinel values used for ‚Äúnot employed‚Äù)  
- `DTI = AMT_ANNUITY / AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` (debt-to-income)  
- `LTI = AMT_CREDIT / AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` (loan-to-income)  
- `ANNUITY_TO_CREDIT = AMT_ANNUITY / AMT_CREDIT`

These are created in preprocessing and used across pages.

---

## üîß Tech stack & dependencies
- Python 3.13+ (recommended)  
- Core libs: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- See `requirements.txt` for exact, pinned packages.

## üöÄ Future scope / enhancements
- Add interactive Plotly charts (zoom, hover tooltips) for drill-down.

- Add export buttons (download filtered CSV, export charts to PNG).

- Add authentication/role-based access for sensitive datasets.

- Automate preprocessing via CI or background job; add versioning for processed artifacts.

- Add unit tests for preprocessing and integration tests for pages.

- Add Dockerfile for reproducible deployment.

- Integrate modeling pipeline (train/test + SHAP explanations) and provide model scoring simulator.

- Improve performance with precomputed groupbys, Downsampling of dataset.
